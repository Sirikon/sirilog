__SiriLog__ is a system event log really simple and easy for administrators who need to record everything that happens.

__Tested on Tekkit!__

But... what exactly does SiriLog?
=================================
SiriLog records events on your server, and whenever SiriLog record 15 events, save them in a file called "sirilog.log" in "plugins/SiriLog" with the time and date it was recorded, the coordinates and world of the event, the user that caused it and the affected block type.</p>

In the future will be able to save the data in a MySQL database.</p>
